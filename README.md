# USGS-Lidar-python-package

 At AgriTech, we are very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help us improve our research on new agricultural products being tested on farms.

## Description
**LiDAR** (light detection and ranging)  is a popular remote sensing method used for measuring the exact  distance of an object on the earthâ€™s surface. Laser scanners and GPS accommodate for the information and they  yield geographical data. This geographical data is then configured and processed though GeoPandas for  simplicity. GeoPandas currently implements GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame types which are subclasses of  pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame respectively. GeoPandas objects can act on shapely geometry objects and  perform geometric operations.
